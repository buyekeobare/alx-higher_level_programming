"""Solves the N-queens puzzle.
Determines all possible solutions to placing N
N non-attacking queens on an NxN chessboard.
Example:
    $ ./101-nqueens.py N
N must be an integer greater than or equal to 4.
Attributes:
    board (list): List of lists represent the chessboard.
    solutions (list): List of lists containing solutions.
Solutions are represented in the format [[e, d], [e, d], [e, d], [e, d]]
where `e` and `d` represent the row and column, respectively, where a
queen must be placed on the chessboard.
